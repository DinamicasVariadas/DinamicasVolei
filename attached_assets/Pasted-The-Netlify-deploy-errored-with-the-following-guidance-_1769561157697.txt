The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

Diagnosis

- Relevant log lines: [line 47](#L47), [line 50](#L50), [line 52](#L52), [line 61](#L61), [line 69](#L69), [line 71](#L71).
- Error type: npm ENOENT — npm cannot find package.json.
- Cause: Netlify ran the configured build command npm run build at the repository root, but there is no package.json at /opt/build/repo/package.json (the repo root). That means either package.json was not committed to the repo, or your project’s package.json lives in a subdirectory (monorepo) and Netlify is building from the wrong directory.

Solution

1) Verify package.json is present and committed
- Confirm a package.json exists in your repository and is committed. If you expect it at the repo root, make sure it appears in the main branch. If it lives in a subfolder (for example frontend/ or app/), note that path.

2a) If package.json should be at repo root but is missing
- Add and commit package.json to the repository root. Example minimal package.json with a build script:
```json
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "your-build-command"
  }
}
```
- Replace "your-build-command" with the actual build step (for example "vite build", "react-scripts build", etc.).

2b) If package.json is in a subdirectory
- Update Netlify to run the build from that subdirectory. Choose one of these methods:

Option A — Set the Base directory in Netlify UI
- In Site settings > Build & deploy > Continuous Deployment > Build settings, set "Base directory" to the subdirectory that contains package.json (for example frontend). Leave build command as the normal script (e.g., npm run build). Update the "Publish directory" to the output folder relative to that base directory (for example dist or build).

Option B — Change the build command to cd into the subdirectory
- In Netlify UI (or netlify.toml), set Build command to:
```bash
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```
- And set Publish directory to the built output path, e.g. frontend/dist or frontend/build.

Option C — Add a root package.json that delegates to subfolder
- Create a package.json at repo root with a build script that runs the subfolder build:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build"
  }
}
```
- Commit this package.json so npm run build works from the root.

3) Confirm Netlify build settings match
- After making the changes, trigger a new deploy. Ensure Netlify’s resolved config (Build command and Publish directory) reflect where the build output actually lives. The logs show the current publish path is /opt/build/repo/dist/public ([line 71](#L71)) — update it if your output is elsewhere (for example frontend/dist).

Notes
- Do not leave the build command pointing to npm run build at the root if package.json is not there; either provide the package.json at root or change the base directory/build command to the correct folder.
- If you need help identifying where package.json actually is in your repo, check the repository tree in your GitHub repo and confirm the path before updating Netlify.
